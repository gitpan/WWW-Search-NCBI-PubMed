DESCRIPTION
    PubMed is the National Library of Medicine's search service that
    provides access to over 11 million citations in MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and
    other related databases, with links to participating online journals.
    This module is an interface to access this service via the generic
    "WWW::Search" interface. This class exports no public interface; all
    interaction should be done through WWW::Search objects.

      $www_search->native_query( my $query_pubmed = 'stress AND cardiovascular risk' );

      while ( my $r = $www_search->next_result )
      {

NCBI DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHT
    I personally encourage everybody to read
    <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/disclaimer.html> before using the
    service via this module. Because using it is like surfing the original pages
    i am sure all legal consequences that refer to the website are
    inherited by this tool. 

    Please read http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/disclaimer.html.

BUGS AND CAVEATS
    While this tool tries to present the original information in its essence
    via extracting interesting information, it may fail to do so. So do not
    rely on the information retreived by this tool without rigorous
    confirmation of the original sources (http://www.pubmed.com website or
    original print journal articles).

    Because the parser depends on the static webserver response it may brake
    as soon as the html is significantly altered. Please inform the author
    via 

    http://rt.cpan.org

    if this happens and subject all other reports there. Escpecially I am open 
    to every improvement towards robust parsing.
